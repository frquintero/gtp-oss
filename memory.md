## Recent changes (Aug 24, 2025)

### Cross-Terminal Command Palette Compatibility
- Completely rewrote the command palette to work in all terminal types:
  - Fixed cursor positioning issues in Konsole and other non-VSCode terminals
  - Implemented a more robust terminal-agnostic approach using standard ANSI codes
  - Eliminated terminal-specific behaviors for consistent experience
  - Added better screen clearing and redrawing for smoother visuals
  - Ensured cursor stays in the correct position in all terminal types

### Version Update
- Updated version to 2.1.0 to differentiate from globally installed version
- Updated version strings in:
  - CLI welcome message
  - Package metadata
  - Launcher script

### Command Palette Improvements
- Fixed critical bugs and enhanced the command palette in `src/ui/command_palette.py`:
  - Fixed character duplication and echo issues when typing in the palette
  - Corrected cursor positioning to maintain focus next to the `/` character
  - Fixed backspace handling to properly remove characters
  - Solved multiple character display problems when filtering quickly
  - Improved filtering to prioritize commands that start with typed text
  - Added proper line redrawing instead of character-by-character display
  - Ensured cursor position is properly maintained throughout palette interaction
  - Enhanced visual feedback showing current filter text in the help line

### Command Input Behavior Changes
- Modified the CLI input behavior in `src/cli.py`:
  - Changed to use raw terminal mode for improved key handling
  - Enter now sends the current prompt
  - Ctrl+J inserts a newline
  - Ctrl+C quits the application
  - Removed explicit 'exit' and 'quit' commands

### Command Palette Feature
- Added a new slash command palette in `src/ui/command_palette.py`:
  - Type `/` at the prompt to see available commands
  - Arrow key navigation to select commands
  - Incremental filtering by typing
  - Enter to select, Escape to cancel
  - Implemented with pure Python (no external dependencies)

### Code Cleanup & Optimization
- Removed unnecessary dependencies (prompt_toolkit)
- Improved terminal handling with proper mode restoration
- Enhanced command import handling in the CLI
- Updated documentation in README.md

### Previous Changes
- Added a conservative math transformer `MathFormatter` in `src/ui/formatters.py`.
  - `transform_math_regions(text)` converts only explicit math regions (`$...$` and `\[...\]`).
  - Supports simple conversions: `\frac{a}{b}` -> `(a)/(b)`, `\sqrt{...}` -> `√(...)`, etc.

- Integrated the math transformer into response rendering in `src/ui/panels.py`.
- Added tests in `tests/test_math_transform.py`.

## Files touched

- `src/ui/formatters.py` — added `MathFormatter`, compatibility wrapper, and docstring/indent fixes.
- `src/ui/panels.py` — apply math transformation prior to Markdown rendering.
- `tests/test_math_transform.py` — unit tests for the transformer.

## Next steps (recommended)

1. Run the full test suite with the project's venv to confirm there are no regressions:

   .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q

2. Expand the transformer mappings as needed (more Greek letters, common LaTeX macros, better fraction handling).

3. Make math rendering optional via a CLI toggle (Pretty/Raw) so users can disable transformations if they need raw LaTeX.

4. Add more unit tests for edge cases: nested braces, `\frac` with complex numerators/denominators, `\left`/`\right`, and code-block isolation.

5. Manual review: run the CLI (`.venv/bin/python gpt.py help`) and test several prompts containing inline and display math to ensure Markdown rendering remains correct.

If you want, I can: run pytest here and paste the output, add the CLI toggle for math formatting, or extend the transformer mappings next.

## Latest test run (captured)

- Command executed: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q`
- Result: 3 failed, 12 passed (see failures below).

Failing tests (from the run):

1. TestValidators.test_export_format_validation
  - Error: AttributeError: type object 'InputValidator' has no attribute 'validate_export_format'

2. TestValidators.test_command_parsing
  - Failure: parsed result reported `is_command == False` for `save test.json` (expected True)

3. TestValidators.test_save_command_validation
  - Error: AttributeError: type object 'CommandValidator' has no attribute 'validate_save_command'

These failures indicate the file-related validation and command parsing helpers were missing or removed.

## Actions taken since the failing run

- Restored/added validation helpers in `src/utils/validators.py`:
  - `InputValidator.validate_export_format(fmt)` — accepts `json`, `txt`, `md`.
  - `CommandValidator.validate_save_command(args)` — validates `save <filename>` usage.
  - Reintroduced file-related commands into `CommandValidator.parse_command` valid set: `save`, `load`, `list`, `export`, `template`.

- Added a compatibility wrapper `MathFormatter.clean_latex_math` and fixed docstring/indent issues in `src/ui/formatters.py` during testing.

## Current status & recommended verification

- Code edits to fix the three failing tests were applied locally in the repo (see `src/utils/validators.py`).
- I attempted to re-run the full test suite in the project's `.venv` from this environment; the runner invocations completed here but the assistant-run pytest output was not captured in full by the interface.

Please re-run tests locally to confirm passing state and capture output:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest -q
```

If any failures remain, paste the failing test output here and I'll fix them immediately.
